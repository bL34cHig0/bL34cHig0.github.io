## Hi there, I'm Habeeb!

- I am an emerging cybersecurity professional with a keen interest in `penetration testing` & `red teaming`. 

- I am currently a penetration tester intern at [CyberPlural](https://cyberplural.com/)

- I am [ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity](https://www.credly.com/badges/69bd2d67-e575-45e2-90c8-ad1d832c98b7/public_url)

- I started this journal to document my notes on `cybersecurity`, `ctf`, and `open source`.
