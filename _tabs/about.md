## Hi there, I'm Habeeb!

- I am a cybersecurity professional with a keen interest in `penetration testing` & `red teaming`. 

- I am currently a penetration tester at [CyberPlural](https://cyberplural.com/)

- I hold the [PJPT](https://api.accredible.com/v1/frontend/credential_website_embed_image/certificate/121637350?key=e218e8959da3aab09ee8669236f94b6d18baaef6e5f80c161849de14ac71373a) and ISC2 [CC](https://www.credly.com/badges/69bd2d67-e575-45e2-90c8-ad1d832c98b7/public_url) certification
